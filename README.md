# cs542_ml_project
Final project for CS542 (machine learning) at BU.

# Requirements
LightGBM requires the use of 64 bit python 3. Required libraries can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Evaluation Instructions (on SCC)
*I would recommend looking at this: the size of the data, models, and training time are significant*

All of the results and models are available on the SCC in */projectnb/cs542sp/netflix_wrw2/CS542-final-project/*. To view, open a jupyter session with these parameters:
| modules            | python3/3.8.10                                                               |
| prelaunch commands | source /projectnb/cs542sp/netflix_wrw2/CS542-final-project/venv/bin/activate |
| interface          | notebook                                                                     |
| working directory  | /projectnb/cs542sp/netflix_wrw2/CS542-final-project/                         |
| number cores*      | 8-16 *(for training)*                                                        |

# Execution Instructions (code process)

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was done in SAS.

# Model Training
Model training is done by running the "model_training.ipynb" notebook.

# Results Analysis
Results analysis of the model can be run through the "results.ipynb" notebook.
